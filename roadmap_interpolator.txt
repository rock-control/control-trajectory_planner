1. Create a cartesian Bezier Curve interpolator- Completed
2. Adapt the above controller for joint space path planning- Add velocity and acceleration checks. Use the Kuka IIWA as the test case. To be completed by Oct end.
3. Extend the bezier curve for various special cases. i.e. different start and end accelerations. (In stage 2 we develop it with C"(0)=C"(end)=0). By nov end
4. Modify the path planning interpolator for explicit trajectory planning. 
5. Check the requirements for different use cases and integrate into the libray without loss of generality
6. Online generation of trajectory  if speed of operation permits
7. Addition of other interpolation programs like polynomial, NURBS if found necessary
